this secret to the taste of this signature steak entrée at america's largest casual chain is found in the blend of flavors in the spicy cajun marinade. plan to make this dish 12 to 24 hours in advance, so the steaks have time to soak up the goodness. this marinating time will also give the meat tenderizer a chance to do its thing, but don't go longer than 24 hours or the protein fibers may become so tender that they turn mushy. i used mccormick brand tenderizer, which uses bromelian, a pineapple extract, to tenderize the meat. lawry's (adolph's) meat tenderizer, uses papain from papayas, to tenderize the proteins, but this brand also brings other spices into the mix and will alter the flavor of your finished product. both of these tenderizers include a lot of salt so we won't need to include salt as part of the marinade formula.""  one more thing, bourbon street is a name of a street in new orleans, la.  there is no indication that applebee's ever included bourbon in the original recipe.","['top sirloin steaks', 'worcestershire sauce', 'soy sauce', 'chili powder', 'garlic', 'meat tenderizer', 'paprika', 'ground black pepper', 'ground cayenne pepper', 'onion powder', 'oregano', 'water', 'salted butter', 'garlic powder', 'salt', 'olive oil', 'white onions', 'white mushrooms']",18

update: i have changed the name of this recipe from ají de gallina (peruvian chicken & chile pepper stew) which was the name given to the original recipe that i adapted here, because people kept posting negative ratings that seemed based exclusively (or nearly so) on this dish's lack of authenticity rather than on the quality of the dish, even after i posted in the intro that the dish was indeed not traditional. i hope under the new name people will be more willing to enjoy it for what it is, rather than getting so wrapped up in where the recipe comes from. cheers.","['whole chicken', 'onion', 'carrots', 'celery', 'fresh dill', 'fresh parsley', 'bay leaves', 'black pepper', 'cayenne pepper', 'salt', 'water', 'orange juice', 'lime juice', 'chilies', 'sweet butter', 'onions', 'turmeric', 'garlic cloves', 'ground cumin', 'white bread', 'evaporated milk', 'walnuts', 'new potatoes', 'parmesan cheese', 'hard-boiled eggs']",25

out the door starting at 12:30pm.  we would fax in our orders in
advance to avoid the ridiculous lines - that was until other people
caught on and began faxing in their orders also :-(.  even so, it
was always well worth the wait.

i consider this to be good old fashioned comfort food and a wonderful winter dish.  and it can be a great way to get some goodness into the kids without the fuss.  this dish generally serves around four people, but you can add or take out to suit the numbers.

(note from my fiance):  i grew up with this dish from an early age and has always been a family favourite.  my mother used to make up a huge stock-pot of it and it would last us all for days at a time.  so this meal isn't only a good comfort food, but highly economical if you don't have much money to spend on the richer foods.","['mushrooms', 'garlic', 'self raising flour', 'beef', 'milk', 'salt', 'pepper', 'thyme', 'sage']",9

anyway, i've made his salmon w/ baked herbs & caramelized lemons oodles of times now and even played with it by using salmon steaks and other types of fish. when i play with the quantities i normally just adjust the ingredients to what i think would be suitable and always with great results. feel free to experiment with yours, but for now i will post the recipe just the way he has it on page 240 of his cookbook, sunday lunch and other recipes from the f word.

store it in an airtight & preferably dark tin/container, and in a cool & dry place; depending on the freshness of the spices you have used & your storage conditions, this should last for up to 6 months.
you can buy this as yellow or red ras-el-hanout, i have made up the yellow version - it's the one i mainly use in my cooking!
please note - this is not a hot spice mix - but an aromatic & very fragrant one! if you want to ""perk"" it up a bit, add more cayenne pepper.
i have added optional ingredients - spices which may be difficult to obtain, but if you have them, add them!!
would make a great gift too!

fajitas start with the marinade. these marinades for beef fajitas rely on the acid ingredients like lime juice not just for flavor, but to tenderize the meat. some marinades use papaya juice to tenderize and flavor the meat. beef fajitas should be marinaded for several hours or up to 24 hours. i include only one marinade for beef and (god forgive me!) one for chicken. some marinades contain fresh or dried chilis as a heat source. there is nothing written in stone when it comes to the ingredients for the marinades. some have bottled salad dressing, tequila or coca-cola.

there are three choices in cooking fajitas: grilling, oven broiling or pan-frying.

grilling is the traditional method of preparing fajitas. when the coals are ready (notice i said coals - not gas!), drain the marinade from the meat and allow the meat to come to room temperature. cook about 3 inches above the coals for approximately 6 minutes on each side for skirt steaks between 1 and 1 1/2 pounds. when the meat is cooked to your liking, remove from the grill and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. cut across the grain and diagonally into finger-lehgth strips.
oven broiling (only when the weather is bad and you can't light the grill!) broil the meat about 4 inches below the broiler for 5 to 6 minutes per side, then let meat rest and slice as above for grilling.
pan-frying (only if you have a large cast iron skillet) drain the meat then cut across the grain, diagonally as above. fry the strips over high heat, working in batches, if necessary, turning frequently. they should take between 1 1/2 to 2 minutes to cook.

to eat fajitas, you roll them in a flour tortilla (real mexicans use corn tortillas), but not by themselves. the proper fajita feast will include a stack of warm tortillas, grilled or fried onions and bell peppers, pico de gallo, guacamole and if you are a yankee, a little sour cream!","['skirt steaks', 'flour tortillas', 'onions', 'bell peppers', 'red wine vinegar', 'tequila', 'canola oil', 'fresh lime juice', 'garlic cloves', 'brown sugar', 'fresh jalapenos', 'fresh cilantro', 'worcestershire sauce', 'ground cumin', 'dried oregano leaves', 'lemon pepper', 'fresh ground black pepper', 'salt', 'garlic', 'black pepper', 'olive oil', 'cilantro', 'salt and pepper', 'tomatoes', 'white onion', 'cucumber', 'radishes', 'cilantro leaves', 'serrano chilies', 'white wine vinegar', 'avocados', 'jalapeno chile', 'lime juice', 'garlic powder', 'green onion']",35
